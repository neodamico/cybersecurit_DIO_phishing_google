# cybersecurit_DIO_phishing_google
## A project from the cybersecurity course on the DIO platform where we use Kali Linux to create a phishing page for Google's homepage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exercise required that the phishing target page be the Facebook login page. However, from the date of the course to the date I am completing the activity, Kali Linux was unable to capture the data entered on the fake page. Therefore, to complete the activity, I changed the target page from Facebook to Google.
